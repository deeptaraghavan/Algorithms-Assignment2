Autocomplete is a handy feature found in cell phones, search engines, and other applications, helping users quickly find the words they need from a set dictionary. For this assignment, we had to develop an automatic word-completion system using a DLB trie. The system needed to store words, track how often they were selected, and suggest words based on the user’s inputted prefix.

The first part of the assignment involved building a DLB trie that contained all the words from the given dictionary while also keeping a score of how many times each word was chosen. To do this, I wrote an add method that inserted words into the trie by navigating through sibling and child nodes. I also created a helper method called throughMethod, which functioned similarly but was specifically designed to check whether a word matched the user’s input. This method played a key role in notifyWordSelected, which increased a word’s score when selected, and getScore, which returned the word’s score. To verify that everything worked correctly, I tested my implementation using the provided A2test.java file.

The second part of the assignment focused on retrieving word suggestions. I created a Suggestion class to store possible completions and wrote a compareTo method to sort suggestions in descending order based on their scores. I then used an ArrayList to store the suggested words. By calling throughMethod, I was able to check if each word matched the prefix inputted by the user. To further refine the process, I implemented a retrieveWords method, which took in a word, the suggestion list, and the current node in the trie. If a word was already in the dictionary, it was added to the list along with its score, and the method continued searching through child and sibling nodes. If the word wasn’t already present, it was added to the dictionary.

One of the main challenges I faced was ensuring that the trie traversal worked correctly so that scores updated properly and the right words appeared as suggestions. I also initially didn’t realize that the program needed to allow new words to be added to the dictionary, which caused some issues with my output.

The worst-case runtime for different parts of the project varies depending on factors like dictionary size, word length, and the number of matching suggestions. The worst-case time complexity for inserting a word into the DLB trie is O(n), where n is the length of the word. Both updating a word’s score and retrieving it run in O(1) time, while retrieving word suggestions has a worst-case complexity of O(n).

Overall, this assignment was both challenging and rewarding. It gave me a deeper understanding of DLB tries and helped me improve my programming skills.
